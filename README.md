# 👩‍⚕️ PCOS Image Classification using Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a **deep learning image classification model** to detect **Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)** using ultrasound images. Using a dataset of enhanced ovarian images categorized as `infected` and `notinfected`, we aim to classify them accurately with the help of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.

## 🧠 Motivation

- Early and accurate detection of PCOS can improve treatment outcomes.
- Current diagnosis often relies on manual interpretation of ultrasound images.
- Automating this process with AI can assist radiologists and reduce diagnostic delay.
